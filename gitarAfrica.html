        <h2 class="headers">What is Tishoumaren?</h2>
        <p class="desc">Tishoumaren, also known as desert blues, is a style of music based in The Sahara/Sahel region of northern and West Africa. Countries that are usually included in this genre is:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Mali</li>
            <li>Niger</li>
            <li>Libya</li>
            <li>Western Sahara</li>
            <li>Burkino Faso</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="desc">Guitar has quickly become  a traditional instrument in this area, despite it's origins. An instrument that is also traditionally played in West Africa is the Kora, a twenty-one stringed instrument that is similar to a harp. The genre was created first by the <b>Tuareg</b> or <b>Tamasheq</b> people. Young men who often wandered around town would sing sons with thei guitar, and they were called Ishumar. The originators of this genre wa a group of Ishumar who formed their group in camps, called Tinariwen (More of them later). The music style of Tishoumaren mixes electric blues with Middle Eastern and African sounds. The music is usually played with a <i>tende</i> drum. African guitar and desert blues is probably my favorite style of music, or at least a close contender. If I'm listening to music, it's probably "Kidan Africa". I think that people is Western Sahara are the best guitarists.</p>

        <!--ALI FARKA-->
        
        <img src="ali.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:10px ">
        <span><h3>Ali Farka Toure</h3></span>
        <p><span>Ali Ibrahim "Ali Farka" Toure was a <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali” class="link"> Malian </a> singer who popularized African Guitar music outside of Africa. He was ranked 76 on the Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of all time, and 37 on Spin magazine's "100" Greatest Guitarists of all Time. He had 10 siblings, but was the only one to live past infancy. In Africa, it is customary to give a child a strange nickname if you've had other children who died. His was "Farka", meanig donkey. He is an extremely good guitarists and he probably has some of my favorite songs ever.</span></p>
        <p><b>Here are my favorite of his songs</b></p>

        <img src="les.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right: 30px ">
        <h3>Les Filles de Illighadad</h3>
        <p><span>Les Filles de Illighadad is a girl group founded by Fatou Seidi Ghali. She is known as the first Tuareg woman to play guitar professionally! Their age is officially unknown, as they have no birth certificates, but they say they are in their 20s. They sing about life as nomads, <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Africa” class="link">religion</a>, and folk songs passed down through generations.</span></p>
        <p>Here are their best songs.</p>

        <h3>Boubacar Traore</h3>
        <p><span>Boubaar Traore actually introduced me to this genre, and because of that I hold him dear to my heart. He is from Mali, and honestly putting him here is a bit of a stretch but I don’t really care. He also goes by the name “Kar Kar”. Here are some of my favorite of his songs.</span></p>

        <p>All in all, Tishoumaren is my favorite genre of music. I think that it’s the best, because in music like this you can really hear the generation struggles and success’ of west african people. West Africans are extremely divided, and music like this can bring us back to our roots and I think that it’s really beautiful.</p>
